# README

This application is based on Rails 5.2.3 and Ruby 2.6.3. There is one gem dependency 'devise'.
I used to to make my login page.
No other dependencies or stuff required, to try it out just bundle and launch.

I did not maintain it since I left school, so it's maybe broken for some reasons.
I don't code in Ruby anymore so it's very likely that there will never be an update on this.
